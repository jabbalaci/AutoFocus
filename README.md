AutoFocus
=========

There are some sites that I use often but the focus is
not set on the input field. So whenever I visit these sites,
I always need to click on the input field before I could start
typing. I got fed up and decided to put an end to this
frustration.

The script is very simple. You specify the site (you can use
regular expressions) and the ID of the input field.
When you visit this site, the focus is put automatically
on the input field.

You need the Greasemonkey add-on to use this script.
